    Let fancy still in my sense in Lethe steep;
    If it be thus to dream, still let me sleep!
    Lethe, the river of oblivion, rolls her watery labyrinth,
    which whoso drinks forgets both joy and grief
    O sister, mother, wife.
    Sweet Lethe is my life.
    I am never, never, never coming home!

        -- Willian Shakespeare [Twelfth Night], John Milton [Paradise Lost], Sylvia Plath [Amnesiac]

Lethe is a tiny and well-simple tool for data wiping. In Greek mythology Lethe is one of the five rivers from Hades
underworld. According to the myth, who touch, drink or even take a single drop from this river will experience
forgetfulness.

This is my implementation of a suggestion given by the worldwide known cryptographer and information security specialist
Bruce Schneier in his book "Applied Cryptography", about destroying information:

    "Most commercial programs that claim to implement the DoD standard overwrite three times: first with all ones, then with
     all zeros and finally with a repeating one-zero pattern. Given my general level of paranoia, I recommend overwriting a
     deleted file seven times: the first time with all ones, the second time with all zeros, and five times with a
     cryptographically secure pseudo-random sequence. Recent developments at the National Institute of Standards and Technology
     with electron-tunneling microscopes suggest even that might not be enough. Honestly, if your data is sufficiently valuable,
     assume that it is *impossible* to erase data completely off magnetic media. Burn or shred the media; it's cheaper to buy
     media new than lose your secrets."

         -- Bruce Schneier ["Applied Cryptography" 228-229 pp.]

This book was written at 90's. DoD additionally states that:

    "The number of times an overwrite must be accomplished depends on the storage media, sometimes on its sensitivity, and
     sometimes on different DoD component requirements."

        -- National Computer Security Center ["A Guide to Understanding Data Rememberance in Automanted Information Systems"]

Here, overwrite times are configured by the user. Anyway, I think that burn-and-shred advices given by Mr. Schneier should
not be discarded.

WARNING: This general DoD information destruction method does not work with flash based filesystems. It probably will not
work with your smartphone. Do not use this tool for doing this! Maybe in future I may extend this code to give some kind
of support for flash stuff too, but by now, I won't do it.

Finally, I am not reponsible for any misuse of information or code here. I am not responsible for any possible damage,
data destruction or loss (partial or total) done by this software, too. Who knows your babysitter! Use it at your own
risk!

How to use Lethe as a command line tool?
----------------------------------------

Lethe is a well-simple tool. It works based on commands and command options. The general idea when using lethe from your
command line is:

                lethe <command> [options]

Until now lethe has the commands listed in Table 1.

+-------------+--------------------------------------+
|   Command   |             Utility                  |
|-------------+--------------------------------------|
|   drop      | Removes files and directories        |
|   help      | Offers quick help guide for commands |
|   man       | Manual reader                        |
|   version   | Displays the tool version            |
+-------------+--------------------------------------+
        Table 1: Current commands supported.

The command drop
----------------

It removes files. Its synopsis is:

                lethe drop <file name and/or glob patterns> [options]

Supposing you want to remove the file "thanks-for-nothing.txt" and all files containing "crimson-ballroom" in their names:

                you@Hades:~/tmp# lethe drop thanks-for-nothing.txt *crimson-ballroom*
                you@Hades:~/tmp# _


By default Lethe will ask you if do you really want to delete a found file. If you prefer skipping all possible
confirmations you must use --ask-me-nothing bool option.

                you@Hades:~/tmp# lethe drop *make-it-alright* televison-addict* \
                > --ask-me-nothing
                you@Hades:~/tmp# _


The removing process basically consists on repeated overwrites and renames passes. By default you have five overwrite
passes and ten renaming passes. In order to change those default values use the options --overwrite-passes=<n> and/or
--rename-passes=<n>. The total of passes must be one at least or a greater value. Let's use 200 renaming and 1000
overwrites passes.

                you@Hades:~/tmp# lethe drop * --ask-me-nothing \
                > --overwrite-passes=1000 --rename-passes=200
                you@Hades:~/tmp# _

WARNING: The given sample command can be dangerous depending on where you are testing it. Lethe always recursively removes
any found directory. I meant that it will be emptied by using an implicit "*" glob pattern. Be careful when using this
tool.

The renaming and overwriting stuff uses random data. By default those data is provided by the internal Lethe's randomizer.
If you prefer providing your own randomizer you need to use the option --dym-randomizer=<lib-path>:<function-name>.

Supposing you have a dynamic local library called "my-awesome-csprng.so". This library has the function "mac"
well-exported and it is "your awesome csprng":

                you@Hades:~/tmp# lethe drop [AB]-REPORTS-*-1995.DAT \
                > --dym-randomizer=my-awesome-csprng.so:mac --ask-me-nothing
                you@Hades:~/tmp# _

The C-prototype for a Lethe randomizer implementation is:

                unsigned char randomizer(void);

The command man
---------------

It shows the content of this manual at your terminal screen by using your environment pager:

                you@Hades:~/tmp# lethe man

The command help
----------------

Nothing special. It only gives you a quick command synopsis. You only need to provide as option a command as the help
topic you are looking for:

                you@Hades:~/tmp# lethe help drop

The command version
-------------------

It reports the version of your Lethe binary:

                you@Hades:~/tmp# lethe version

But you can also use --version if you prefer:

                you@Hades:~/tmp# lethe --version
